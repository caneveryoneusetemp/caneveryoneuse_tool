# How to use

Every component library has a dedicated json-file you can find in src/json.

If you want to add a new component-library you need to
1. Create a new json-file. Name it [framework].json.
2. Copy the template from template.json.
3. Fill in the results of your analysis. Check [template.md](template.md) for more information on how to fill out the document
